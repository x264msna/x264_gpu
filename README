Project will help to integrate HW Encode across GPU and/or CPU as:
- NVidia's CUDA Video Encoder 
- and more..
within API of x264 that can help to improve the speed up of video encode process.

No source code changes would be needed in the 3rd application that currently 
use x264, Handbrake is taken for now.

please expect first commit within a week or two with a beta quality :)

thanks you.
